# 1. GTA Quiz Architecture Refactor

**Date: 11/01/2024**

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our GTA Quiz game is a heavily requested game by the users on our discord server. This game mimicks black tea by mudae; however, the current implementation has several challenges:

1. Performance Issues
    * Individual message deletions causing unnecessary API calls
    * Inefficient caching strategy in AniListService
    * Potential race conditions in reaction handling
    * No connection pooling for external API calls

2. Architectural Issues:
    * High coupling between game logic and Discord interaction code
    * Lack of clear separation of concerns
    * Difficulty in testing components independently
    * No clear event handling system

## Decision

We will implement a new architecture with the following key components:

1. Event-Driven Architecture:
    * Implement a central `GameEventManager` for event handling
    * Define clear event types and handlers
    * Use events for communication between components

2. Service Layer Pattern:

    Create specialized services:
    * `GameManager`: Core game state and logic
    * `QuizRoundService`: Round management and question generation
    * `PlayerService`: Player state and interaction
    * `MessageService`: Discord message handling
    * `AniListService`: External API interaction

3. Performance Optimizations:

    * Implement smart caching with hit counting
    * Batch Discord API operations
    * Use queues for reaction processing
    * Add connection pooling

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Improved Maintainability:
   * Clear separation of concerns
   * Easier to add new features
   * Better code organization
   * More testable architecture

2. Better Performance:
   * Reduced API calls through batching
   * More efficient caching
   * Better handling of concurrent operations
   * Improved resource utilization

3. Enhanced Reliability:
   * Better error handling
   * Clearer recovery mechanisms
   * Reduced race conditions
   * More robust state management

4. Improved Development Experience:
   * Easier to understand codebase
   * Better testing capabilities
   * Clearer component boundaries
   * More modular design

### Negative
1. Increased Complexity:
   * More files and components to manage
   * Need for additional documentation
   * Learning curve for new developers
   * More complex deployment

2. Development Overhead:
   * Initial setup time for new architecture
   * Need to maintain event system
   * More boilerplate code
   * Additional testing requirements

### Mitigations
1. For Complexity:
   * Provide clear documentation
   * Create standard patterns for common operations
   * Use consistent naming conventions
   * Implement clear logging strategy

2. For Development Overhead:
   * Create templates for common components
   * Use dependency injection for easier testing
   * Create development guidelines
